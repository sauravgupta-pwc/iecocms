	<detail_desc>Living in our own home is a dream of every person. While a majority of home buyers use a home loan to finance their purchase, you still need enough money to make a heavy down payment in addition to ensuring that your monthly income will be sufficient to pay your EMI. A proper financial planning is needed with sound investment expertise to accumulate enough money to buy a home.</detail_desc>
	<offer_label>Do you know?</offer_label>
	<offer_desc>If you plan to buy a home worth 50 Lakhs today,  10 years from now the same house will cost Rs. 1 crore (assuming 7% inflation). You have to pay Rs. 20 Lakhs as downpayment. Have you accounted for this? Not yet! Now is also not late. Start investing now. It is achievable by doing a SIP for just Rs. 20000 which are expected to return 8% return</offer_desc>
